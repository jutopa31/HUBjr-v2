    - paragraph [ref=e19]: This antiseizure medication selection tool is designed to assist healthcare providers both in diagnosing / classifying seizures and choosing an appropriate medication monotherapy. We recommend monotherapy when possible, because of the potential drug interactions. With the exception of treatment of absence seizures, this app does not consider ASMs for adjunct therapy. It is designed for use in patients whose seizures start at age 10 years or older.
    - paragraph [ref=e20]: The algorithm was developed by Ali A. Asadi-Pooya, Sándor Beniczky, Emilio Perucca, Stefan Rampp, Guido Rubboli and Michael R. Sperling. The app was programmed by Stefan Rampp. The project was supported by a grant from the Danish Epilepsy Centre and Filadelfia Research Foundation. The translation into Portuguese was done by Isabella D'Andrea, Vanessa Cristina Colares Lessa, Elza Márcia Yacubian, Katia Lin and Fabio A. Nascimento.The translation into Ukranian was done by Yuliia Solodovnikova, Tetiana Marusich, Elisa Babych, Iryna Hnatiuk, Anastasiia Prokopiuk, Kateryna Sarazhyna, Alina Ivaniuk, Anzhelika Buhaienko. The translation into Japanese was done by Kazutaka Jin, Nobukazu Nakasato. The translation into French was done by Pierre Mégevand, Laurent Sheybani. The translation into Italian was done by Roberta Roberti, Emilio Russo, Simona Lattanzi, Antonietta Coppola, Simona Balestrini, on behalf of the antiseizure drug commissione of LICE (Italian League against Epilepsy). The translation into Hungarian was done by Levente Hadady, Sándor Beniczky.

        - paragraph [ref=e92]: This program is designed for medical professionals. The app is based on available clinical evidence and the expert opinions of the app developers. It is not an official guideline, and the recommendations do not replace standard health care practice. Interpretation of the content and data presented are the responsibility of the user. This tool is designed to aid the prescriber, but does not substitute for that person's judgment and for the need to take into consideration additional patient-related variables not included in the software algorithm. The final decision regarding prescription of medication is the responsibility of the user, who may choose a different treatment than is suggested by this app. The designers do not take responsibility for failure of prescribed medication to control seizures nor any adverse effects that patients may experience. Users should be aware that antiepileptic medication may fail to control seizures and may produce adverse effects, some of which may be serious or life-threatening. Users should have detailed knowledge about any drug they prescribe and be familiar with efficacy and adverse effect profiles.
        - paragraph [ref=e93]: The user understands that this is not a medical device and that the user must independently review the basis for the recommendations presented by the program so that the medical professionals using the app do not rely primarily on such recommendations, but rather on their own judgment, to make clinical decisions for individual patients.
        - paragraph [ref=e94]: Data entry and choices made in the app will be saved anonymously so that app performance can be analyzed and improved. The authors may choose to publish about the use of the app, and no users will be identified in any way.
